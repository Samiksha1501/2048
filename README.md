# Features 
- Interactive 4x4 Grid:
A 4x4 grid where the game is played. The grid is dynamically generated, with tiles appearing in random empty spots at the start of each turn.
- Tile Merging and Movement:
Tiles move based on user input (arrow keys or swipe gestures on mobile). Tiles with the same value merge when they collide, doubling in value.
- Score Tracking:
Real-time score tracking that increases whenever tiles merge. The score is updated instantly with each move.
- Random Tile Generation:
Each turn, a new tile (either a "2" or "4") is added to a random empty spot on the grid, ensuring the game continues to progress.
- Winning Condition (2048 Tile):
The game ends when the player reaches the "2048" tile or when there are no more valid moves available.
